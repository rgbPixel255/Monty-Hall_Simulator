This is a Monty-Hall simulator! If you don't know what is Monty-Hall problem, you can read more about here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.

Steps: 1.Typically, Monty-Hall problem is arised with 3 doors, but you can obtain clearer results by increasing doors amount. 2.Choose the door where you think the goat is, but as you can guess, that's irrelevant at this point. 3.All other doors are deleted, except one door. Now you have 2 doors and goat is behind one of them. 4.You must choose keep your door or pick the other one (╭Õ_ õ ) 5.You can repeat the experiment with this choices as many times as you want. This way, you could obtain results faster than one by one.

IMPORTANT! You can repeat the experiment with the same doors amount, so you could change some decisions and see how success percentage change. You can restart the whole experiment and change doors amount as well, and results will restart too.
